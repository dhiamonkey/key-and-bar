                <h4><a href="">Definition of Legal Counsel</a></h4>
                <p>
                  The term lawyer retainer or lawyer retainer may not be very
                  familiar to the public. What most people know is that a lawyer
                  plays a role in providing legal assistance to his clients.
                  However, not many know how a lawyer's system works.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  Returning to the term retainer attached to the profession of
                  lawyers, this term actually refers to a system in providing
                  legal aid services, the work system of retainer lawyers is to
                  provide legal assistance to their clients, with a certain
                  period of time. Generally, this period lasts from 6 months to
                  5 years. The retainer system is quite beneficial for clients.
                  The reason is that the client does not have to spend too much
                  money to use legal aid services on a regular basis, both in
                  judicial and non-judicial channels, compared to the costs that
                  must be incurred, if the client incurs costs for each legal
                  consultation or case handling.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  This retainer lawyer service is widely used by companies, but
                  not a few individuals also request legal assistance with this
                  system. Generally, retainer lawyer services will be sought
                  when there are problems encountered or there are legal issues
                  that companies or individuals want to consult.
